And with that, we are going to wish you a happy Sunday morning and tuck the blog up for the night.

Thank you, for choosing to spend your 2019 election campaign with us. I haven’t had much of a chance to look through the comments but I can tell from some of the messages and tweets you are sending a lot of you are disappointed with how the election panned out. That is the nature of democracy – someone always has to lose.

But we are so lucky to be able to live in a country where you can criticise the leaders, where you can make jokes about them on public forums, poke fun at slogans, rage against the establishment and believe whole-heartedly in a cause your government doesn’t and all that happens when it doesn’t go your way is disappointment.

For those who are disappointed tonight, take heed in your democracy. It is imperfect. Of course it is. But it’s yours. And tomorrow is another day.

For those who got their wish, congratulations. May this incoming government live up to your expectations and more.

And for the country at large, let’s hope that we do get the unity both sides promised us, regardless of the result.

This country still has big problems. And it will take big, and united, thinking to solve them. Those economic headwinds Scott Morrison has been warning us about are not going anywhere soon. Employment is still a problem. The climate emergency is not getting any smaller. Once the dust settles, and the Coalition tax cuts are legislated, people will look to see what comes next.

It’s those answers we all wait for. To those who voted for the first time in this election, congratulations. To those who took a risk and put themselves up to the vote on behalf of the community, put your feet up and take a moment to think about what you achieved. (Unless you are a nazi. No matter what happens, we will hopefully always say no to you.) To those who worked on the campaigns and lost, to the families and loved ones, to those who suddenly find themselves without a job – again, take a moment. There is another of these in three years.

And to those who won, take your moment to sit back and take in what you did.

The House of Representatives has 151 members. The coming challenges mean you all have to be on your A-game.

To everyone who kept this blog rolling today, to my wonderful colleagues in Canberra and beyond, thank you for keeping my fingers rolling and my brain ticking.

And to everyone who read, left comments, tweeted, sent messages, or just those “quiet” blog readers, thank you. We can not say that enough.

Morrison is back at work tomorrow, and so are we. We hope you drop by. For now, rest. Or watch Eurovision. Whatever it is that diverts you from politics for the moment.

And most importantly – take care of you.

And before we call it a morning, here is the state of play on those in-doubt seats:

The results in eight undecided seats will determine whether Scott Morrison will govern in his own right, or be reliant on lower-house votes from the crossbench.

The Coalition needs to win two of the eight seats that remained too close to call at the end of counting on Saturday night to reach the 76 lower-house seats necessary to form government.

It had a narrow lead in two of the seats, the South Australian seat of Boothby and the Victorian seat of Chisholm.

Labor was leading in five seats, the Queensland seats of Blair and Lilley, the New South Wales seats of Eden Monaro and Macquarie and the West Australian seat of Cowan.

Independent Kerryn Phelps was narrowly in front in the Sydney seat of Wentworth that she won at the by-election caused by the resignation of Malcolm Turnbull.

Almost 73% of the vote has been counted and counting will resume Sunday.

And before we bid you adieu and wish you a very good morning, here is how the night went:

We’re doing something different … and we’d like to explain why. Our journalism now reaches record numbers around the world and more than a million people have supported our reporting. Unlike many news organisations, we haven’t put up a paywall – our journalism remains accessible to all, so more people have access to accurate information with integrity at its heart. This is The Guardian’s model for open, independent journalism.

Our model enables people to support us in a way that works for them. Readers’ support safeguards our essential editorial independence.

While talk will turn to the polls, because, well, they weren’t right – the one poll that did nail it, was preferred prime minister. Consistently.

Now, for those wondering, the current Senate doesn’t finish up until 30 June.

Usually that would mean they are done and dusted – but the government did not get its tax cuts through the parliament before the election.

Scott Morrison said, if he won, he would bring the parliament back, in June, to legislate the tax cuts before 30 June, so the ATO could process the tax rebate the Coalition promised low- and middle-income earners, which equates to just over $1,000.

So Fraser Anning gets at least one more week inside the Senate chamber.

Also making the rounds on social media is Bill Shorten telling Arnold Schwarzenegger he was going to be the next prime minister of Australia.

Michael McCormack is making happy with the “like” button on Twitter, liking all the well-wishes.

He’s earned it. Make happy with that “like” button, WB. You deserve those congratulations.

We’ve just been spending a bit of time checking off the many seats that were close pending pre-poll votes.

Most of these have now reported.

There are three seats that are quite close with a lot of pre-polls yet to report and I’d like to wait until the morning to call them.

They are Eden-Monaro and Hunter (both Labor) and Swan (Liberal).

These three seats look likely to go with the incumbent party.

With those added to the party totals we get to 73 Coalition and 65 Labor, along with three independents and three members of minor parties.

There are then another seven seats that I think are too close to call. Labor is leading in Chisholm, Cowan, Lilley and Macquarie, although they are projected to fall behind in Chisholm.

The Liberal party is leading in Bass and Boothby. Independent MP Kerryn Phelps is narrowly ahead in Wentworth.

The best-case scenario for Labor would see them with 71 seats, against 73 for the Coalition and seven crossbenchers. In that scenario they would probably need six of the seven crossbenchers to form government.

Bearing this in mind it is no longer possible to see a path to government for Labor.

The best-case scenario for the Coalition is that they win 80 seats, but it is still quite possible they will fall short of a majority and need to rely on the crossbench to form government.

It is remarkable how similar this is to the last election. At that election the Liberal-National Coalition won 76 seats to Labor’s 69, along with five crossbenchers.

Since then, independent Zali Steggall has won Warringah, and potentially Phelps will win the seat of Wentworth, which was held by Malcolm Turnbull in 2016.

Labor has lost Braddon, Lindsay, Longman and Herbert. They have gained Gilmore and now hold Corangamite and Dunkley after they were redrawn as notional Labor seats.

That means a net loss of one seat for Labor.

Among the seven seats still in play, Labor is trailing in their seat of Bass, but just ahead in the Liberal seat of Chisholm. Again, that would equal no change.

Looking at the count, there doesn’t seem to be much of a shift from the status quo for the government – right now it is looking like 76. That could change, of course. These are fluctuating numbers.

But if 76 is the case, the government remains in the same position it was in 2016.

The “miracle” is that Scott Morrison almost single-handedly dragged it back there.

Wentworth is still looking too close to call, but Dave Sharma might just pip Kerryn Phelps at that one. At this stage.

Another point – after all the rumbles of needing to de-merge the LNP in Queensland, there will not be a single LNP member who mentions that tonight. The LNP, as one party, will stand, and Lawrence Springborg, who brought it together through sheer force of will, stands vindicated.
