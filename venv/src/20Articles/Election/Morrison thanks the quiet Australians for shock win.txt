"It's Australians who have worked hard, started a business, started a family, bought a home," he said to loud cheers.

"These are the quiet Australians who have won a great victory tonight."

Morrison pledged to "get back to work" as soon as possible. "We are an amazing country of amazing people. God bless Australia."
