Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has claimed victory in a stunning political "miracle" that has devastated the Labor Party, forced Bill Shorten to step down as its leader and reshaped the country's politics.

Morrison vowed to get "back to work" after holding power at the federal election in a shock result that puts the Coalition on course for a narrow majority in federal Parliament.

"I have always believed in miracles," Morrison said to a cheering audience of Liberal supporters in Sydney at midnight on Saturday (early Sunday morning, NZT), shortly after he had received a phone call from Shorten conceding defeat.

Shorten had been favoured in exit polls and made significant gains in some seats in New South Wales and Victoria, while independent candidate Zali Steggall defeated former prime minister Tony Abbott in Warringah.

But his bid to become Australia's 31st Prime Minister - through a platform of tax, wages and climate policy reform - was in deep trouble with his party suffering damaging defeats in key electorates the party needed to claim power.

Shorten announced he would stand down as Labor leader while staying in Parliament, adding the federal election campaign had been "toxic at times" but that Labor had fought for ambitious change.

The election result was yet to be finalised at the end of election night, with several seats in doubt, but the Coalition defied the opinion polls to hold its ground and win seats from Labor.

With almost three quarters of the vote counted, the Coalition had 74 of the 151 seats in the House of Representatives and was within sight of forming government in its own right or with support in a hung Parliament.

The Prime Minister said the election was a victory for the "quiet Australians" rather than about the Liberal Party or himself.

"Tonight is about every single Australian who depends on their government to put them first," he said.

"That is exactly what we are going to do. Our government will come together after this night and we will get back to work.

"That is our task and that is my undertaking to Australians from one end of the country to the other.

"I said I was going to burn for you and I am â€“ every single day."

Shorten singled out Labor deputy Tanya Plibersek, shadow treasurer Chris Bowen and Senate leader Penny Wong for praise in a concession speech to party supporters in Melbourne.

"I know that you're all hurting and I am too," Shorten said.

Two days after the death of Labor hero Bob Hawke, Shorten said he had wanted to achieve victory for Australians who needed better healthcare, an expanded Medicare, greater school funding and other policies.

"Gee, I wish we could have formed a government for these Australians on this evening. I wish we could have won for the true believers, for our brothers and sisters in the mighty trade union movement," he said.

"I wish we could have done it for Bob."

Morrison, who won the leadership after Malcolm Turnbull was deposed in a leadership coup last August, was on track in late counting to secure the 76 seats needed to form government and secure one of the most impressive victories in the Liberal Party's history.

Morrison's presidential-style campaign focussing on income tax cuts and risks to the economy under Labor led the Coalition to significant gains in Queensland and Tasmania while limiting losses NSW and Victoria. His staunch opposition to Shorten's plans to tax higher-income earners appears to have resonated with voters living outside inner-city seats.

Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton celebrated his victory over Labor candidate Ali France in the Queensland seat of Dixon by quoting former Labor prime minister Paul Keating.

"This is the sweetest victory of all," Dutton said, before paying tribute to Morrison.

"He's been able to campaign in marginal seats, he's been able to put pressure on Bill Shorten, and it's what Bill Shorten deserved."

Shorten had been a warm favourite and made gains in some seats in NSW and Victoria, while independent candidate Zali Steggall defeated former prime minister Tony Abbott in Warringah. However, the result represents a devastating defeat for the former union leader whose position as leader of the ALP is now in grave danger.

His bid to become Australia's 31st Prime Minister - through an ambitious platform of tax, wages and climate policy reform - receded as election night went on.

Labor infrastructure spokesman Anthony Albanese acknowledged the opposition had a "redistributive agenda" by increasing some taxes to fund health and education, as well as taking action on climate change and do more for indigenous Australians. Albanese praised Shorten and accepted responsibility for the outcome as a member of the frontbench team.

Albanese blamed a Coalition "scare campaign" for the outcome, a view also put by Labor deputy leader Tanya Plibersek.

The Coalition, which has trailed Labor in the polls throughout its turbulent time in government, went in to the campaign with 74 seats and added to that tally across Queensland, where it defeated Labor in Longman and Herbert. Queensland was a disaster for Labor which recorded a 26.6 per cent primary vote in the Sunshine State.

The Coalition also wrested the Tasmanian seat of Braddon from Labor and appeared likely to claim the neighbouring electorate of Bass as well.

With the electorate enduring more than a decade of unprecedented parliamentary bloodletting - Australia has had seven Prime Ministers in 11 years - many neutral observers were hoping for a period of political stability.

However, the result shows the nation is divided along geographic and ideological lines with Abbott declaring a political "realignment" with Labor making gains in progressive wealthy seats and the Coalition doing better in working class areas.

A group of key independents could still hold the key to power.

Abbott said the Coalition would be able to retain government even though he conceded he would lose his seat of Warringah, a safe Liberal electorate for years that came under attack from independent candidate Zali Steggall and her campaign for more action on climate change.

"The good news is that there is every chance the Liberal National Coalition has won this election," Abbott said.

"This is a really extraordinary result, it is a stupendous result, it is a great result for Scott Morrison and the rest of the Liberal team, and Scott Morrison will quite rightly enter the Liberal pantheon forever."
