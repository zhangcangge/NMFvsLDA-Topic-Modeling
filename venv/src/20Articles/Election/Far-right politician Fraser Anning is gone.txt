The Queensland senator who infamously blamed Muslim immigration for the New Zealand terrorist attacks in March is out, experts predict.

ABC analyst Antony Green said far-right senator Fraser Anning would go "back to where he came from."

Anning formed his own party -- called Fraser Anning's Conservative National Party -- and ran candidates in seats across the country.

But so far it has failed to win more than 0.6% of the national vote.
